# Ball-Plate-Control
This is a project done for a Master Thesis in the Electromechanical Engineering (specialization: Mechatronics), it is about the design and control of a Ball and Plate Didactic Device. This device is intended to be developed into a Commercial device and maybe sold to educational institutes or young apprentices in the field of Control Systems. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

things you need to install before running the code:
- Arduino ide
- Python 2.7
- opencv 2

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
